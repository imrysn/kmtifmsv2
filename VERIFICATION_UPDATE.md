# Verification Script Update

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The verification script was incorrectly flagging `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` as an external resource.

### What is `xmlns`?

`xmlns` is the **XML Namespace declaration** - it's NOT an external URL that gets fetched. It's just metadata that tells the browser "this is SVG content."

**It's required for SVG to work properly and is completely safe.**

### Updated Verification

The script now only checks for actual external resources:
- ✅ `flaticon.com` - External icon CDN
- ✅ `cdn-icons` - External icon CDN  
- ✅ `https://fonts` - Google Fonts
- ✅ `https://cdn` - Other CDN resources

But **ignores** safe SVG namespace declarations like:
- ✅ `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` - Safe (not fetched)
- ✅ `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"` - Safe (not fetched)

## Run Verification Again

```bash
npm run verify:security
```

**Expected result**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

## Why SVG xmlns is Safe

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- This is just metadata, no network request is made -->
</svg>
```

The browser uses this to identify SVG content, but it **never makes a network request** to that URL. It's purely a namespace identifier.
