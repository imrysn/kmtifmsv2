# Electron Security & Stability Fixes

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Warning** 
**Error**: `Electron Security Warning (Insecure Content-Security-Policy)`

**Root Cause**: The application had no Content Security Policy defined, exposing users to unnecessary security risks including XSS attacks.

**Fixes Applied**:
- âœ… Added CSP meta tag to `client/index.html`
- âœ… Configured CSP headers in Electron session (`main.js`)
- âœ… Different policies for development (more permissive) and production (strict)
- âœ… Enabled `webSecurity` and disabled `allowRunningInsecureContent` in BrowserWindow

**CSP Configuration**:
```
Development: Allows localhost connections for hot reload
Production: Strict policy for maximum security
```

### 2. **GPU Process Crash**
**Error**: `GPU process exited unexpectedly: exit_code=-1073740791`

**Root Cause**: Hardware acceleration issues with the GPU driver or incompatible graphics settings.

**Fixes Applied**:
- âœ… Disabled hardware acceleration via `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()`
- âœ… Added error handler for child process failures
- âœ… Graceful error logging for GPU crashes

**Note**: This error code (-1073740791 = 0xC0000409) indicates a stack buffer overrun in the GPU process. Disabling hardware acceleration prevents this crash.

## Files Modified

### 1. `client/index.html`
- Added Content-Security-Policy meta tag

### 2. `main.js`
- Disabled hardware acceleration
- Added CSP session configuration
- Added child-process-gone event handler
- Enhanced webPreferences security settings

---

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Restart the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify CSP is working**:
   - Open DevTools (should open automatically in dev mode)
   - Check Console - CSP warning should be gone
   - No "Insecure Content-Security-Policy" warnings

3. **Verify GPU crash is fixed**:
   - Monitor the terminal/console
   - No more "GPU process exited unexpectedly" errors
   - Application should run smoothly without crashes

---

## Understanding the Warnings

### Why CSP Matters
Content Security Policy prevents:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Data injection attacks
- Clickjacking
- Unauthorized resource loading

### Why Disable Hardware Acceleration?
Hardware acceleration can cause:
- GPU driver compatibility issues
- Rendering crashes on certain systems
- Instability with older graphics cards
- Stack buffer overruns in GPU process

**Trade-off**: Slight performance decrease in exchange for stability and compatibility.

---

## Production Considerations

### Before Building for Production:
1. Test thoroughly with hardware acceleration disabled
2. If GPU crash was rare, consider re-enabling for performance:
   ```javascript
   // In main.js, comment out:
   // app.disableHardwareAcceleration();
   ```

3. Monitor production logs for GPU errors
4. Keep CSP strict in production (already configured)

## Additional Security Best Practices

âœ… **Already Implemented**:
- Context isolation enabled
- Node integration disabled
- Remote module disabled
- Sandbox enabled
- Web security enabled
- CSP configured

ðŸ”’ **Current Security Status**: Excellent

## Troubleshooting

### If CSP warnings persist:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart the app completely
3. Check DevTools for specific CSP violations
4. Adjust CSP rules if legitimate resources are blocked

### If GPU errors persist:
1. Update graphics drivers
2. Check Windows graphics settings
3. Try running as administrator
4. Check for Windows updates

### Performance Issues:
If the app feels slow after disabling hardware acceleration:
1. This is expected on some systems
2. Consider re-enabling for testing
3. GPU crash may have been a one-time issue
4. Monitor error logs

---

## Success Indicators

âœ… No CSP warnings in DevTools Console  
âœ… No GPU process crash errors in terminal  
âœ… Application runs smoothly  
âœ… All features working normally  
âœ… Security warnings resolved

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any problems:
1. Check the console for specific error messages
2. Review the CSP configuration in the DevTools Network tab
3. Test with hardware acceleration enabled/disabled
4. Check for conflicting Electron flags or settings

**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025  
**Electron Version**: 27.0.0  
**Status**: âœ… All critical security warnings resolved
