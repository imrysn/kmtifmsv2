#### **Fixed File Grouping Logic**
- ✅ Updated filtering to properly categorize files based on exact status values:

  - Pending: Yellow/amber (#fff3cd)
  - Approved: Green (#d1f2eb)
  - Rejected: Red (#f8d7da)
- ✅ Added responsive design breakpoints
- ✅ Added loading and empty state styles

## Visual Consistency Achieved

### Status Color Scheme (Matching Admin Panel)
- **Pending Team Leader**: Yellow/Amber background with brown text
- **Pending Admin**: Yellow/Amber background with brown text
- **Final Approved**: Green background with dark green text
- **Rejected**: Red background with dark red text

### Layout Consistency
- Clean, compact file listings
- Consistent padding and spacing (16px-20px)
- Uniform border radius (12px for cards, 8px for buttons)
- Consistent hover effects with orange accent bar
- Same card-based design patterns

### File Item Design
- File icon (40px) + Filename (flex-grow) + Status badge (fixed width)
- Simple, scannable single-line layout
- Orange accent bar on hover (left edge)
- Subtle shadow on hover

## Database Status Values Reference

The system uses these status values in the database:
- `uploaded` - File uploaded, pending team leader review
- `team_leader_approved` - Team leader approved, pending admin review
- `final_approved` - Admin approved, file is final
- `rejected_by_team_leader` - Rejected by team leader
- `rejected_by_admin` - Rejected by admin

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/components/user/MyFilesTab.jsx`
2. `client/src/components/user/FileApprovalTab.jsx`
3. `client/src/components/user/css/MyFilesTab.css`
4. `client/src/components/user/css/FileApprovalTab.css` (created)

## Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ Test double-click functionality in My Files submitted section
2. ✅ Verify status badges display correctly for all file states:
   - Uploaded files show "Pending Team Leader Review"
   - Team leader approved files show "Pending Admin Review"
   - Final approved files show "Final Approved"
3. ✅ Check responsive design on mobile devices
4. ✅ Verify file grouping works correctly (Not Submitted vs Submitted)
5. ✅ Test that removed details (size, date, tags) are gone from compact view
6. ✅ Confirm UI matches Admin panel styling
