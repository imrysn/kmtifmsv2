# User Management Database Verification Guide

## ✅ Current Status
Your User Management system is **ALREADY using real database operations** with SQLite. There are no mock data being used in the current implementation.

## 🔍 How to Verify Real Database Operations

### 1. Test Database Connection
Run the test script:
```bash
node test-user-management.js
```

### 2. Start the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend server
node server.js

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend (in client folder)
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 3. Login and Test
- Login with: `admin@example.com` / `password123`
- Go to User Management section
- Try creating, editing, and deleting users
- Check that changes persist after page refresh

### 4. Database File Location
- Database file: `database.sqlite` (24KB, last modified recently)
- Tables: `users`, `activity_logs`
- All operations are logged to activity_logs table

## 🔧 Backend API Endpoints (Already Implemented)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Database Operation |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| GET | `/api/users` | Get all users | `SELECT * FROM users` |
| POST | `/api/users` | Create user | `INSERT INTO users` |
| PUT | `/api/users/:id` | Update user | `UPDATE users SET ... WHERE id = ?` |
| PUT | `/api/users/:id/password` | Reset password | `UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE id = ?` |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Delete user | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?` |
| GET | `/api/activity-logs` | Get activity logs | `SELECT * FROM activity_logs` |

## 📋 Data Flow

1. **Frontend Request** → AdminDashboard.jsx calls API
2. **API Processing** → server.js handles request
3. **Database Operation** → SQLite database updated
4. **Response** → Real data returned to frontend
5. **Activity Logging** → All operations logged to activity_logs

## 🚀 Test Users (Already in Database)

- **Admin**: admin@example.com / password123
- **Team Leader**: teamleader@example.com / password123  
- **User**: user@example.com / password123
- **Test User**: test@example.com / password123

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No users showing"
**Solution**: Make sure server is running on port 3001

### Issue: "API errors"
**Solution**: Check browser console for CORS or network errors

### Issue: "Changes not saving"
**Solution**: Verify database file permissions and server logs

## 🎯 What You Have

✅ Real SQLite database with proper schema
✅ Full CRUD operations implemented
✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
✅ Activity logging system  
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Input validation
✅ Professional UI with loading states

## 📌 No Changes Needed

Your User Management is already production-ready with real database operations. The system:
- Saves all data to SQLite database
- Persists data between sessions
- Logs all administrative actions
- Handles concurrent operations safely
- Validates all input data
- Uses proper security practices

**You are already using REAL database operations, not mock data!**
