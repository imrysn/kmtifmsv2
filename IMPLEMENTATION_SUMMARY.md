# File Approval Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a file picker functionality to the admin file approval process. When an admin approves a file, they can now select a destination folder in the network projects directory, and the file will be moved there automatically.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Changes (`server/routes/files.js`)

#### New Endpoint: `/api/files/:fileId/move-to-projects`
- **Method:** POST
- **Purpose:** Moves an approved file from the uploads directory to the network projects directory
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "destinationPath": "/TeamName/2025",
    "adminId": 1,
    "adminUsername": "admin",
    "adminRole": "ADMIN",
    "team": "IT Administration"
  }
  ```
- **Functionality:**
  - Gets file information from database
  - Verifies source file exists in uploads directory
  - Constructs full network path: `networkProjectsPath + destinationPath`
  - Creates destination directory if it doesn't exist
  - Checks for duplicate files in destination
  - Copies file to destination with original filename
  - Updates database with new file path
  - Logs the activity

### 2. Frontend Changes (`client/src/components/admin/FileApproval.jsx`)

#### New State Variables
```javascript
const [showLocationPicker, setShowLocationPicker] = useState(false)
const [currentPath, setCurrentPath] = useState('/')
const [directoryItems, setDirectoryItems] = useState([])
const [isLoadingDirectory, setIsLoadingDirectory] = useState(false)
const [selectedDestination, setSelectedDestination] = useState(null)
```

#### New Functions

**`fetchDirectory(path)`**
- Fetches directory contents from the file system API
- Used to browse through network project folders

**`navigateToFolder(folderPath)`**
- Navigates to a different folder in the location picker
- Resets the selected destination

**`selectDestination(item)`**
- Selects a folder as the destination for the approved file
- Only allows folder selection (not files)

**`openLocationPicker()`**
- Opens the location picker modal
- Sets default path to: `/{Team}/{Year}`
- Example: `/Engineering/2025`

**`moveFileToProjects()`**
- Gets the actual network path for the selected folder
- Calls the move API endpoint
- Then calls `approveFileAfterMove()` on success

**`approveFileAfterMove()`**
- Approves the file after successful move
- Updates the UI
- Shows success message

#### Modified Function

**`approveFile()`**
- Now opens the location picker instead of directly approving
- Adds comment if provided before opening picker

### 3. UI Components

#### Location Picker Modal
A new modal that appears when admin clicks "Approve":

**Features:**
- Shows file information (name, team)
- Displays default location suggestion
- Shows current path being browsed
- Lists all folders and files in current directory
- Allows double-click to navigate into folders
- Single-click to select a folder as destination
- Visual feedback for selected folder
- Cancel and "Approve & Move to Selected Folder" buttons

**User Experience:**
1. Admin clicks "Approve" on a file
2. Location picker opens with default path: `{Team}/{Year}`
3. Admin can browse folders by double-clicking
4. Admin selects destination folder by single-clicking
5. Selected folder is highlighted
6. Admin clicks "Approve & Move to Selected Folder"
7. File is moved and approved
8. Success message is displayed

### 4. CSS Styles (`client/src/components/admin/FileApproval.css`)

#### New Styles Added

```css
/* Location Picker Modal */
.location-picker-modal
.location-picker-info
.current-path
.directory-browser
.directory-list
.directory-item (with states: hover, selected, folder, file)
.item-icon
.item-name
.item-action
.selected-destination
.location-picker-actions
```

**Visual Design:**
- Clean, modern interface
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Folder icons for easy identification
- Highlighted selection with primary color
- Disabled state for files (only folders selectable)
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## File Flow

### Before Implementation
```
User uploads file → File stored in networkDataPath/uploads
                  ↓
Admin approves → Status changed to "final_approved"
                ↓
File stays in uploads directory
```

### After Implementation
```
User uploads file → File stored in networkDataPath/uploads
                  ↓
Admin clicks approve → Location picker opens
                     ↓
Admin selects folder → File moved to networkProjectsPath/{Team}/{Year}
                     ↓
                     → Status changed to "final_approved"
                     ↓
                     → Database updated with new path
                     ↓
Success notification shown
```

## Default Path Structure

When the location picker opens, it defaults to:
```
\\KMTI-NAS\Shared\Public\PROJECTS\{Team}\{Year}
```

Example for Engineering team in 2025:
```
\\KMTI-NAS\Shared\Public\PROJECTS\Engineering\2025
```

## Database Updates

The following fields are updated when a file is moved:
- `public_network_url`: Full path to the moved file
- `projects_path`: Directory where the file was moved to

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Source file not found**: Returns 404 error
2. **Destination file already exists**: Returns 409 conflict error
3. **Network path not accessible**: User-friendly error message
4. **Permission denied**: Clear error message about permissions
5. **General errors**: Caught and displayed to user

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] File approval opens location picker
- [ ] Default path is set to {Team}/{Year}
- [ ] Can browse folders by double-clicking
- [ ] Can select folder by single-clicking
- [ ] Selected folder is highlighted
- [ ] Can cancel and return to file details
- [ ] File is moved to selected location
- [ ] File is approved after move
- [ ] Database is updated correctly
- [ ] Success message is displayed
- [ ] Error messages display correctly
- [ ] Works with different teams
- [ ] Works with different years
- [ ] Handles duplicate files correctly
- [ ] Handles network errors gracefully

## Configuration

The network paths are configured in:
```javascript
// server/config/database.js
networkProjectsPath = '\\\\KMTI-NAS\\Shared\\Public\\PROJECTS'
networkDataPath = '\\\\KMTI-NAS\\Shared\\data'
```

## Security Considerations

1. Only admin users can approve and move files
2. File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
3. Duplicate file checks prevent overwriting
4. All operations are logged in the activity log
5. Admin credentials are required for all operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Add breadcrumb navigation in location picker
2. Add folder creation functionality in location picker
3. Add search within location picker
4. Add file preview before approval
5. Add bulk approval with folder selection
6. Add custom path input field
7. Remember last used location per team
8. Add folder favorites/bookmarks

## Notes

- The original file in the uploads directory is copied (not moved) to preserve the upload history
- The location picker uses the existing file system API (`/api/filesystem/browse`)
- The implementation is fully responsive for mobile devices
- All operations are logged for audit purposes
