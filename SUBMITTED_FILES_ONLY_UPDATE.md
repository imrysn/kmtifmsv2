## Code Changes

### Sidebar Count (UserDashboard-Enhanced.jsx)
```javascript
// Before:
filesCount={files.length}

// After:
filesCount={files.filter(f => 
  f.status === 'uploaded' || 
  f.status === 'team_leader_approved' || 
  f.status === 'final_approved'
).length}
```

### File Filtering (MyFilesTab.jsx)
```javascript
// Before:
const notSubmittedFiles = filteredFiles.filter(f => 
  !f.status || (...)
);
const submittedFiles = filteredFiles.filter(f => 
  f.status === 'final_approved' || f.status === 'uploaded' || f.status === 'team_leader_approved'
);

// After:
const submittedFiles = filteredFiles.filter(f => 
  f.status === 'final_approved' || f.status === 'uploaded' || f.status === 'team_leader_approved'

## Status Mapping

| File Status | Shown in My Files? | Sidebar Count? | Display Text |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| (no status) | ❌ No | ❌ No | - |
| `uploaded` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Pending Team Leader Review |
| `team_leader_approved` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Pending Admin Review |
| `final_approved` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Final Approved |
| `rejected_by_team_leader` | ❌ No | ❌ No | - |
| `rejected_by_admin` | ❌ No | ❌ No | - |

## Workflow Impact

### New User Flow
1. User uploads file → File is automatically submitted for approval (status: `uploaded`)
2. File appears in "My Files" → "Submitted for Approval" section
3. Sidebar shows count of submitted files
4. User can double-click to open file
5. User can view status: "Pending Team Leader Review", "Pending Admin Review", or "Final Approved"

### What Happened to Not Submitted Files?
Files are now **automatically submitted upon upload**, so there's no "Not Submitted" state. The upload modal submits files directly to the team leader for review.

---

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner Interface**: Single section showing only relevant files  
✅ **Accurate Count**: Sidebar count matches visible files  
✅ **Simplified Logic**: Less complex filtering and state management  
✅ **Better UX**: Users see only files in the approval workflow  
✅ **Consistent**: Matches the auto-submit workflow
