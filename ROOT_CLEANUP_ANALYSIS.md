## KMTIFMSV2 Root Directory Cleanup Analysis

### ‚úÖ ESSENTIAL FILES (Keep)
**Core Application Files:**
- main.js (Electron entry point)
- server.js (Current production server - included in build)
- package.json & package-lock.json (Dependencies)
- .gitignore (Version control)
- database.sqlite (Active database)
- README.md (Project documentation)

**Active Directories:**
- client/ (Frontend React app)
- uploads/ (File storage)
- node_modules/ (Dependencies - never delete)
- .git/ (Version control - never delete)

### üóëÔ∏è FILES TO DELETE (Obsolete/Redundant)

**Obsolete Server Files:**
- server-file-approval.js (51KB, Sep 17) - Appears to be an older/alternate version
  Reason: Not referenced in package.json scripts or build config

**Redundant Reset Scripts:**
- reset-db-force.js (Referenced in package.json but potentially obsolete)  
- reset-file-approval-db.js (Specific to old file approval system)
- update-database-file-system.js (One-time migration script)

**Development/Testing Files:**
- test-api.js (Development testing only)
- test-user-management.js (Development testing only)  
- TESTING_GUIDE.md (Development documentation)

**Setup Scripts (Platform Specific - Keep only relevant ones):**
- setup.bat & setup.sh (Generic setup - may be obsolete)
- setup-macos-ui.bat & setup-macos-ui.sh (macOS specific)
  Note: Keep only scripts relevant to your deployment platform

**Build Artifacts:**
- dist/builder-effective-config.yaml (Build artifact - can be regenerated)

### üìã RECOMMENDED CLEANUP ACTIONS

1. **Delete obsolete server files**
2. **Delete development/testing files** (keep for dev environment if needed)
3. **Delete one-time migration scripts**
4. **Clean build artifacts from dist/**
5. **Keep only platform-relevant setup scripts**

### üîç FILES NEEDING VERIFICATION

These files should be checked for current usage before deletion:
- reset-db-force.js (check if still needed)
- setup scripts (keep only for target platform)
- test scripts (keep if still used for development)

### üìä SPACE SAVINGS ESTIMATE
Estimated cleanup: ~100KB+ of obsolete scripts and documentation
Main benefit: Cleaner project structure and reduced confusion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY NOTES
- Never delete node_modules/, .git/, client/, or uploads/
- Backup database.sqlite before any database script cleanup
- Verify server.js is the correct current server before deleting server-file-approval.js
