The file needs to end after the Assignments tab section closes, right before line containing:
"                {/* Key Metrics Cards - Top Row: Clickable Cards */}"

Everything after line "          </div>
        )}" following the Assignments tab should be removed until we hit the Member Files Modal section.

The proper structure should be:
- Assignments Tab (ends around line 1315)
- Then IMMEDIATELY goes to:
      </main> (closes the tl-main tag)
- Then the modals section begins

The orphaned analytics code between lines ~1318-1520 needs complete removal.
