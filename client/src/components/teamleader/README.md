# Team Leader Dashboard - Refactored

## Overview
The Team Leader Dashboard has been refactored following the same pattern as the Admin Dashboard. The refactoring improves code organization and maintainability while **preserving all existing functionality**.

## Structure

### Main Components
- **`Sidebar.jsx`** - Navigation sidebar with team leader tabs
- **`TopBar.jsx`** - Top bar with search, notifications, and user avatar
- **`AlertMessage.jsx`** - Success and error message display component

### Tab Components
- **`OverviewTab.jsx`** - Overview dashboard with stats and team activity table
- **`FileReviewTab.jsx`** - File review interface with analytics, toolbar, and file list
- **`TeamManagementTab.jsx`** - Team members management table
- **`AssignmentsTab.jsx`** - Assignments/tasks management table

### Modals
All modals are located in the `modals/` subdirectory:
- **`BulkActionModal.jsx`** - Bulk approve/reject files
- **`FilterModal.jsx`** - File filtering interface
- **`PriorityModal.jsx`** - Set file priority and deadlines
- **`MemberFilesModal.jsx`** - View team member's files
- **`CreateAssignmentModal.jsx`** - Create new assignments
- **`AssignmentDetailsModal.jsx`** - View assignment details and submissions
- **`ReviewModal.jsx`** - Review individual files with comments and actions

## Key Features Preserved
✅ **All state management** - Every state variable retained in main dashboard
✅ **All API calls** - Every fetch/POST/DELETE request preserved
✅ **All business logic** - Every function and event handler maintained
✅ **All styling** - Using existing TeamLeaderDashboard.css
✅ **All features** - File review, bulk actions, filters, priorities, notifications, assignments, team management

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Better Code Organization**
- Separate files for each tab (easier to find and edit specific features)
- Modals in dedicated directory
- Clear component hierarchy

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to debug and test individual features
- Changes to one feature don't affect others

### 3. **Follows Project Patterns**
- Matches AdminDashboard structure
- Consistent with UserDashboard pattern
- Easy for team members to understand

### 4. **No Functionality Lost**
- All features work exactly as before
- No breaking changes
- Same user experience

## Migration Notes

### Files Changed
1. **App.jsx** - Updated import to use `TeamLeaderDashboard-Refactored`
2. **New components created** - All components in `components/teamleader/`

### Files to Delete (Optional)
- `TeamLeaderDashboard-Enhanced.jsx` - Replaced by refactored version
- `TeamLeaderDashboard-Enhanced-v2.jsx` - Unused file

### No Database Changes Required
- No backend changes needed
- All API endpoints remain the same
- Database schema unchanged

## Testing Checklist
✅ Overview tab displays correctly
✅ File review tab with analytics works
✅ Bulk actions (approve/reject) function
✅ Filters and sorting work
✅ Priority/deadline setting works
✅ Team management displays members
✅ View member files modal works
✅ Assignments tab loads correctly
✅ Create assignment modal functions
✅ Assignment details modal shows submissions
✅ File review modal works
✅ Notifications display and work
✅ Search functionality works
✅ All API calls successful

## Maintenance

### Adding New Features
1. Determine which tab the feature belongs to
2. Edit the corresponding tab component
3. If needed, add new modal in `modals/` directory
4. Export new components in `index.js`
5. Pass required props from main dashboard

### Modifying Existing Features
1. Locate the component (tab or modal)
2. Make changes in that specific file
3. Update props if necessary in main dashboard
4. Test the specific feature

### Best Practices
- Keep all state in main dashboard file
- Pass only necessary props to child components
- Keep API calls in main dashboard
- Components should focus on presentation
- Use clear prop names

## Credits
Refactored following the Admin Dashboard pattern for consistency across the application.
