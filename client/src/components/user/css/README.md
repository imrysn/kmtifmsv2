# User Dashboard CSS Refactoring

## Overview
The original UserDashboard.css file has been refactored and split into component-specific CSS files for better organization and maintainability.

## New Structure
```
css/
├── UserDashboard.css (main layout and shared styles)
├── UserDashboard-Original.css (backup of original)
└── components/
    └── user/
        └── css/
            ├── variables.css (CSS variables and shared utilities)
            ├── Sidebar.css
            ├── AlertMessage.css
            ├── DashboardTab.css
            ├── TeamFilesTab.css
            ├── FileUploadTab.css
            ├── MyFilesTab.css
            ├── FileCard.css
            └── FileModal.css
```

## What Changed

### 1. **Modularized Styles**
- Each component now has its own CSS file
- Easier to maintain and debug specific components
- Reduced CSS conflicts and improved specificity

### 2. **Shared Variables**
- Common CSS variables moved to `variables.css`
- All components import variables for consistency
- Easy to update colors, spacing, and other design tokens globally

### 3. **Component-Specific Imports**
- Each React component imports its own CSS file
- Better code organization and dependency management
- CSS is loaded only when the component is used

### 4. **Main Layout CSS**
- `UserDashboard.css` now contains only:
  - Main container layout
  - Responsive design for main content area
  - Shared header styles

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Each component's styles are self-contained
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one component don't affect others
3. **Better Performance**: CSS is modular and can be optimized better
4. **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different components without conflicts
5. **Reusability**: Components can be easily moved or reused with their styles
6. **Debugging**: Easier to find and fix style issues in specific components

## Import Structure

Each component follows this pattern:
```jsx
import './css/ComponentName.css';

const ComponentName = () => {
  // Component logic
};
```

The main UserDashboard component imports the layout CSS:
```jsx
import '../css/UserDashboard.css';
```

## CSS Variables

All components can use the shared CSS variables defined in `variables.css`:
- Color palette (--user-primary, --macos-blue, etc.)
- Spacing system (--spacing-sm, --spacing-md, etc.)
- Border radius values (--radius-sm, --radius-md, etc.)
- Typography and other design tokens

## Migration Notes

- Original CSS file backed up as `UserDashboard-Original.css`
- All functionality preserved
- Same visual appearance maintained
- All responsive breakpoints kept intact
- Animation and transition effects preserved
