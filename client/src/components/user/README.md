# User Dashboard Components Refactoring

## Overview
This refactoring breaks down the large UserDashboard-Enhanced.jsx file (800+ lines) into smaller, more manageable components in the `src/components/user/` directory.

## Components Created

### 1. **Sidebar.jsx**
- Navigation sidebar for switching between tabs
- Handles logout functionality
- Displays file count for "My Files" tab

### 2. **AlertMessage.jsx**
- Reusable alert component for success/error messages
- Supports different alert types (error, success)
- Includes close functionality

### 3. **DashboardTab.jsx**
- Main dashboard/welcome tab content
- User information display with avatar
- File statistics overview
- Workflow information
- Team leader special notices

### 4. **TeamFilesTab.jsx**
- Team files section (placeholder for now)
- Simple component that can be expanded later

### 5. **FileUploadTab.jsx**
- File upload form with validation
- File selection and preview
- Upload progress handling
- Submission details display

### 6. **MyFilesTab.jsx**
- Lists user's uploaded files
- File filtering and search functionality
- Loading states and empty states
- Uses FileCard component for individual files

### 7. **FileCard.jsx**
- Individual file display component
- Shows file metadata, status, and actions
- Status badge logic
- Click handler for opening file modal

### 8. **FileModal.jsx**
- Detailed file information modal
- Review history and comments
- Status progression display
- Public network links (if applicable)

    └── UserDashboard-Enhanced-Backup.jsx (original)
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the app
3. **Testing**: Smaller components are easier to test individually
4. **Development**: Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously
5. **Performance**: Components can be optimized independently
6. **Code Organization**: Logical separation of concerns

## Changes to Original File

The original `UserDashboard-Enhanced.jsx` has been:
- Reduced from 800+ lines to ~200 lines
- Maintains all original functionality
- Uses component composition instead of monolithic structure
- Preserved all state management and API calls
- Kept the same CSS classes and styling

## Import Usage

You can import individual components:
```jsx
import Sidebar from '../components/user/Sidebar'
import FileCard from '../components/user/FileCard'
```

Or use the barrel export:
```jsx
import { Sidebar, FileCard, AlertMessage } from '../components/user'
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety
2. Implement custom hooks for repeated logic (file operations, API calls)
3. Add loading skeletons for better UX
4. Implement drag-and-drop file upload
5. Add bulk operations for file management
