# Troubleshooting Guide - User Management Blank Screen

## Issue
The User Management tab shows a blank white screen after refactoring.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. **JavaScript Error (Most Likely)**
**Check:** Open Browser Developer Console (F12) and look for errors

**Common Errors to Look For:**
- Module import errors
- Undefined variable errors
- React component rendering errors

**Solution Steps:**
1. Press F12 to open Developer Console
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Take a screenshot and share the error

### 2. **CSS Not Loading**
**Check:** Inspect element and see if styles are applied

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)

### 3. **Modal Components Not Found**
**Check:** Verify modal files exist in correct location

**Expected Structure:**
```
client/src/components/admin/modals/
├── AlertMessage.css
├── AlertMessage.jsx
├── ConfirmationModal.css
├── ConfirmationModal.jsx
├── FormModal.css
├── FormModal.jsx
└── index.js
```

**Solution:** All files are created correctly (verified above)

### 4. **Component State Error**
The UserManagement component now has an ErrorBoundary that will catch and display any errors.

**What You Should See:**
- If there's a React error, you'll see a red error box with details
- If the page is still blank, it means the component isn't rendering at all

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open the app in browser
2. Navigate to User Management tab
3. Press F12
4. Check Console tab for errors
5. Share any error messages you see

### Step 2: Verify Server is Running
```bash
# Make sure your backend server is running
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 3: Check Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Navigate to User Management
4. Look for failed API calls (red entries)
5. Check if `/api/users` and `/api/teams` requests are successful

### Step 4: Test with Original Code
If issue persists, temporarily revert the UserManagement.jsx import:

```jsx
// In UserManagement.jsx, comment out the new imports temporarily:
// import { AlertMessage, ConfirmationModal, FormModal } from './modals'

// And check if it loads without the modals
```

## Error Boundary Added
I've added an ErrorBoundary component that will catch and display any rendering errors. If you see a red error box with details, that's the ErrorBoundary showing you what went wrong.

## Next Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Share the error message/screenshot
3. I can provide a specific fix based on the error

## Rollback Option
If you need to rollback immediately, I can restore the original modals in UserManagement.jsx file.
